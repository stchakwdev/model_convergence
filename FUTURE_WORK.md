## ‚ùì Critical Uncertainties

### Fundamental Questions
- **Pattern vs. Artifact**: Are observed convergences meaningful or coincidental?
- **Measurement Validity**: Do our metrics actually capture alignment-relevant properties?
- **Generalization Limits**: Will patterns hold for future, more capable AI systems?
- **Human Bias**: Are we imposing patterns that don't actually exist?

### Methodological Concerns
- **Selection Bias**: Are we only finding patterns because we're looking for them?
- **Publication Bias**: Would negative results receive equal attention and scrutiny?
- **Reproducibility**: Can other researchers replicate our findings independently?
- **Confounding Variables**: What factors might we be overlooking?

### Scale and Scope Limitations
- **Model Diversity**: Are current models too similar (mostly transformers) for meaningful analysis?
- **Capability Gaps**: Do patterns only emerge at certain capability thresholds?
- **Cultural Bias**: Are patterns specific to Western, English-speaking training data?
- **Temporal Stability**: Will patterns persist as AI development accelerates?
