Expand Tilli Tonse Story Datasets for Comprehensive Analysis

Creates expanded story datasets with sufficient sample size for robust statistical
analysis while maintaining cultural authenticity and the "tilli tonse" framework.

Expansion Strategy:
1. Core story variations with different contexts
2. Character and setting variations 
3. Cultural scenario adaptations
4. Difficulty level variations
5. Domain-specific applications

Target: 50+ stories per capability for publication-quality statistical power
