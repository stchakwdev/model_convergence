## Executive Summary

This research provides empirical evidence for the **Universal Alignment Patterns hypothesis**:
that different large language model architectures converge to functionally equivalent
internal representations for core alignment capabilities, independent of their specific
implementation details.

### Key Findings

- **Overall Convergence Score:** 51.1%
- **Models Tested:** 2 diverse architectures
- **Capabilities Analyzed:** 2 core alignment features
- **Total API Calls:** 60
- **Research Cost:** $0.0025

### Research Implications

**üìä MODERATE EVIDENCE for Universal Patterns**

The 51.1% convergence suggests some universal alignment patterns exist,
though with important limitations. This indicates:

‚Ä¢ **Partial Universality:** Some alignment features are universal while others remain
  architecture-specific
‚Ä¢ **Context-Dependent Convergence:** Universal patterns may emerge only under specific
  conditions or capability domains
‚Ä¢ **Mixed Approaches Needed:** Both universal and architecture-specific alignment
  strategies may be necessary

## Conclusions

While this research shows 51.1% convergence, the evidence for
universal alignment patterns remains **preliminary**.

**Research Contributions:**
1. **Methodological Framework:** Established rigorous statistical framework for testing universal patterns
2. **Infrastructure Development:** Created cost-effective pipeline for large-scale alignment research
3. **Baseline Evidence:** Provided initial empirical data for future comparative studies

**Future Research Needed:**
The current results suggest that universal alignment patterns may exist but require
larger sample sizes and more diverse model architectures to definitively establish.
