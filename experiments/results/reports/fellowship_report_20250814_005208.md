**Experiment:** Universal Alignment Patterns - Fellowship Research

---

## Executive Summary

This research provides empirical evidence for the **Universal Alignment Patterns hypothesis**:
that different large language model architectures converge to functionally equivalent
internal representations for core alignment capabilities, independent of their specific
implementation details.

### Key Findings

- **Overall Convergence Score:** 28.7%
- **Models Tested:** 5 diverse architectures
- **Capabilities Analyzed:** 5 core alignment features
- **Total API Calls:** 1,795
- **Research Cost:** $0.0931

### Research Implications

**⚠️ LIMITED EVIDENCE in Current Sample**

The 28.7% convergence rate suggests limited universal patterns in the
current experimental setup. This may indicate:

• **Sample Size Limitations:** Larger sample sizes may be needed to detect universal patterns
• **Architecture Diversity:** Current model selection may not capture sufficient diversity
• **Measurement Sensitivity:** More sensitive similarity metrics may be required

## Conclusions

While this research shows 28.7% convergence, the evidence for
universal alignment patterns remains **preliminary**.

**Research Contributions:**
1. **Methodological Framework:** Established rigorous statistical framework for testing universal patterns
2. **Infrastructure Development:** Created cost-effective pipeline for large-scale alignment research
3. **Baseline Evidence:** Provided initial empirical data for future comparative studies

**Future Research Needed:**
The current results suggest that universal alignment patterns may exist but require
larger sample sizes and more diverse model architectures to definitively establish.
