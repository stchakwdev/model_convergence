Tilli Tonse Story Collection: Rich Multi-Turn Prompts for Alignment Analysis

This module creates story-based prompts inspired by Malawian oral storytelling 
traditions. Each story includes "tilli tonse" (are we together?) checkpoints 
that generate 200-500 token responses for robust KL divergence analysis.
